# [Trees: Is This a Binary Search Tree?](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-is-binary-search-tree)

- Difficulty:  `#medium`
- Category: `#ProblemSolvingAdvanced`

For the purposes of this challenge,
we define a binary search tree to be a binary tree with the following properties:

- The `data` value of every node in a node's left subtree
    is less than the data value of that node.
- The `data` value of every node in a node's right subtree
    is greater than the data value of that node.
- The `data` value of every node is distinct.

For example, the image on the left below is a valid BST.
The one on the right fails on several counts:

- All of the numbers on the right branch from the root are not larger than the root.
- All of the numbers on the right branch from node 5 are not larger than 5.
- All of the numbers on the left branch from node 5 are not smaller than 5.
- The data value 1 is repeated.

%%{init: {'flowchart' : {'curve' : 'linear'}}}%%
graph TD;
    %% LEFT
    a1([1])
    a2([2])
    a3([3])
    a4([4])
    a5([5])
    a6([6])
    NONE1[ ]

    a3 --> a2;
    a2 --> a1;
    a2 ~~~ NONE1[ ];
    a3 --> a4;
    a4 --> a5;
    a4 --> a6;

    %% RIGHT
    b1([1])
    b2([2])
    b3([3])
    b5([5])
    b6([6])
    b1_1([1])

    b3 --> b2
    b2 --> b1
    b2 ~~~ NONE2[ ];
    b3 --> b5
    b5 --> b6
    b5 --> b1_1

Given the root node of a binary tree, determine if it is a binary search tree.

## Function Description

Complete the function checkBST in the editor below.
It must return a boolean denoting whether or not the binary tree
is a binary search tree.

checkBST has the following parameter(s):

- `root`: a reference to the root node of a tree to test

## Input Format

You are not responsible for reading any input from stdin.
Hidden code stubs will assemble a binary tree and pass its root node to your
function as an argument.

## Constraints

- $ 0 \leq data \leq 10^4 $

## Output Format

Your function must return a boolean true if the tree is a binary search tree.
Otherwise, it must return false.

## Sample Input

```mermaid
%%{init: {'flowchart' : {'curve' : 'linear'}}}%%
graph TD;
    %% LEFT
    a1([1])
    a2([2])
    a3([3])
    a4([4])
    a5([5])
    a6([6])
    a7([7])

    a4 --> a2;
    a2 --> a1;
    a2 --> a3;
    a4 --> a6;
    a6 --> a5;
    a6 --> a7;


    %% Styling
    classDef default stroke:#000,stroke-width:4px,stroke, color:#000,fill:#0F0;
    classDef none fill-opacity:0, stroke-opacity:0;

    class NONE1,NONE2 none
```

## Sample Output

```text
Yes
```

## Explanation

The tree in the diagram satisfies the ordering property for a Binary Search Tree,
so we print Yes.
