# [Tree: Height of a Binary Tree](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/tree-height-of-a-binary-tree)

- Difficulty:  `#easy`
- Category: `#ProblemSolvingAdvanced`

You are given pointer to the root of the binary search tree and
two values `v1` and `v2`.
You need to return the lowest common ancestor ([LCA](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/binary-search-tree-lowest-common-ancestor/copy-from/272004115#:~:text=lowest%20common%20ancestor%20(-,LCA,-)%20of))
of `v1` and `v2` in the binary search tree.

```mermaid
%%{init: {'flowchart' : {'curve' : 'linear'}}}%%
graph TD;
    1([1])
    2([2])
    3([3])
    4([4])
    5([5])
    6([6])

    2-->1;
    2-->3;
    3-->4;
    3-->5;
    5-->6;

    %% Styling
    classDef default stroke:#000,stroke-width:4px,stroke, color:#000,fill:#0F0;
```

In the diagram above, the lowest common ancestor
of the nodes `4` and `6` is the node `3`.
Node `3` is the lowest node which has nodes  and  as descendants.

## Function Description

Complete the function lca in the editor below.
It should return a pointer to the lowest common ancestor node of the two values given.

lca has the following parameters:

- `root`: a pointer to the root node of a binary search tree
- `v1`: a node.data value
- `v2`: a node.data value

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer, `n`, the number of nodes in the tree.

The second line contains `n` space-separated integers representing `node.data` values.

The third line contains two space-separated integers, `v1` and `v2`.

To use the test data, you will have to create the binary search tree yourself.
Here on the platform, the tree will be created for you.

## Constraints

- $ 1 \leq n, node.data \leq 25 $
- $ 1 \leq v1, v2 \leq 25 $
- $ v1 \not = v2 $

The tree will contain nodes with data equal to `v1` and `v`2.

## Output Format

Return the a pointer to the node that is the lowest common ancestor of  and .

## Sample Input

```text
6
4 2 3 1 7 6
1 7
```

```mermaid
%%{init: {'flowchart' : {'curve' : 'linear'}}}%%
graph TD;
    1([1])
    2([2])
    3([3])
    4([4])
    6([6])
    7([7])
    NONE[ ]

    4-->2;
    2-->1;
    2-->3;
    4-->7;
    7-->6;
    7 ~~~ NONE;

    %% Styling
    classDef default stroke:#000,stroke-width:4px,stroke, color:#000,fill:#0F0;
    style NONE  fill-opacity:0, stroke-opacity:0;

```

`v1 = 1` and `v2 = 7`.

## Sample Output

[reference to node 4]

## Explanation

LCA of `1` and `7` is `4`, the root in this case.
Return a pointer to the node.
