Help the ruler of HackerLand determine the cheapest way to
give his citizens access to libraries.

## Solution research

While researching a solution for this problem, I came across an article (*),
which describes an easy-to-understand solution in Python.

Other articles that describe the problem have development guidelines
implemented in C++ that are a little more difficult to understand.

Even so, in the solution found in the article (*), it will not work directly by
copying and pasting the code since the author (apparently on purpose) wrote
wrong the calculation formula by exchanging the cost variables of libraries and paths.
